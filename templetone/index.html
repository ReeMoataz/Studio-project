                                Actually he directed few films but he made a master piece called
                                (Grave of the Fireflies) s a very somber film about the struggle of two children to
                                survive during World War II.
                                Seita and his younger sister Setsuko are left to fend for themselves when their mother
                                passes away from severe burns inflicted by the American fire-bombing of their town,
                                the port city of Kobe. Their father is serving in the Japanese navy, but the children
                                have not heard from him in a long time, so Seita and Setsuko try staying with a distant
                                relative.
                                However, Seita doesn't get along well with this relative and decides to leave, taking
                                Setsuko with him, to live on their own.

                                Not like the classic animation studios, Studio Ghibli was born with one goal: to explore
                                the
                                depths of the human soul, and to offer Japanese and international audiences poetic
                                stories
                                that would translate all its complexity. No international commercial strategy, but a
                                concern
                                for integrity and exemplary quality, for which its productions are renowned

                                It was Hayao Miyazaki who came up with the idea. A avid flyer, he was inspired by the
                                Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli, a surveillance aircraft that was developed in Italy during the
                                Second
                                World War. The Ghibli also refers to the hot air in the Sahara desert, symbolising the
                                breath of fresh air being blown in to Japanese animation.
